Importing spatial data to PostGIS  
  
Introduction  
If you’ve worked with other data types before, then most of the process for importing spatial data will be self-explanatory. However, for someone working with spatial data, acronyms like CRS and SRID might be confusing.  
    
  
For data import, you should know the coordinate reference system (CRS) your data is in and which spatial reference identifier (SRID) number is used to reference that specific CRS. The SRID defines all the parameters of a data set’s geographic coordinate system and projection. Using an SRID is convenient because it packs all the information about a map projection into a single number. When creating spatial objects for insertion into the database, the SRID is required.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Many people refer to OSM as the Wikipedia of maps. If you seek easy ways to get an extract of the data, you can check for GeoFabrik for Shapefiles or osmdata.xyz for GeoPackages.

Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. So, if you need country boundaries, states or railroads in the world on a very general level, this is your data of choice.

```  
INSERT INTO data.islands(geom, the_name )  
  VALUES ( ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)', 4326), 'NULL ISLAND');  
```  
  
shp2pgsql 工具导入  
  
The most common data format for spatial data has traditionally been the ESRI shapefile. shp2pgsql is a command line tool to import ESRI shapefiles to the database. Under Unix, you can use the following command for importing a new PostGIS table:  
  
   
```  
shp2pgsql -s <SRID> -c -D -I <path to shapefile> <schema>.<table> | \  
  psql -d <databasename> -h <hostname> -U <username>  
```
