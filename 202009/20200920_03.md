## 背景                  
pg_stat_activity 是PostgreSQL的动态会话视图, wal sener流复制的上游进程, 可接收流复制command, 通过pg_stat_activity可以查看wal sender这个进程正在执行什么流复制命令.

Make walsenders show their replication commands in pg_stat_activity.    
    
A walsender process that has executed a SQL command left the text of    
that command in pg_stat_activity.query indefinitely, which is quite    
confusing if it's in RUNNING state but not doing that query.  An easy    
and useful fix is to treat replication commands as if they were SQL    
queries, and show them in pg_stat_activity according to the same rules    
as for regular queries.  While we're at it, it seems also sensible to    
set debug_query_string, allowing error logging and debugging to see    
the replication command.    
    
While here, clean up assorted silliness in exec_replication_command:    
    
* The SQLCmd path failed to restore CurrentMemoryContext to the caller's    
value, and failed to delete the temp context created in this routine.    
It's only through great good fortune that these oversights did not    
result in long-term memory leaks or other problems.  It seems cleaner    
to code SQLCmd as a separate early-exit path, so do it like that.    
    
* Remove useless duplicate call of SnapBuildClearExportedSnapshot().    
    
* replication_scanner_finish() was never called.    
    
None of those things are significant enough to merit a backpatch,    
so this is for HEAD only.
