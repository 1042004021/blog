## 背景    
lsm3, 2个top index, 1个basic index.    
    
top index包括当前正在写入的(满足快速写入需求)index, 同时包含一个可以后天在线merge的index.     
    
worker process负责merge, 每个lsm3 index需要1个worker processer进程.    
    
当前还没有pg内置btree效果好, 也许是custom wal接口问题, 或者其他问题.  可以使用oprofile分析一下    
    
https://github.com/postgrespro/lsm3    
    
LSM tree implemented using standard Postgres B-Tree indexes.    
Top index is used to perform fast inserts and on overflow it is merged    
with base index. To perform merge operation concurrently    
without blocking other operations with index, two top indexes are used:    
active and merged. So totally there are three B-Tree indexes:    
two top indexes and one base index.    
When performing index scan we have to merge scans of all this three indexes.    
    
This extension needs to create data structure in shared memory and this is why it should be loaded through    
"shared_preload_library" list. Once extension is created, you can define indexes using lsm3 access method:    
    
```sql    
create extension lsm3;    
create table t(id integer, val text);    
create index idx on t using lsm3(id);    
```    
    
`Lsm3` provides for the same types and set of operations as standard B-Tree.    
    
Current restrictions of `Lsm3`:    
- Parallel index scan is not supported.    
- Array keys are not supported.    
- `Lsm3` index can not be declared as unique.    
    
`Lsm3` extension can be configured using the following parameters:    
- `lsm3.max_indexes`: maximal number of Lsm3 indexes (default 1024).    
- `lsm3.top_index_size`: size (kb) of top index (default 64Mb).    
    
It is also possible to specify size of top index in relation options - this value will override `lsm3.top_index_size` GUC.    
    
Although unique constraint can not be enforced using Lsm3 index, it is still possible to mark index as unique to    
optimize index search. If index is marked as unique and searched key is found in active    
top index, then lookup in other two indexes is not performed. As far as application is most frequently    
searching for last recently inserted data, we can speedup this search by performing just one index lookup instead of 3.    
Index can be marked as unique using index options:    
    
```sql    
create index idx on t using lsm3(id) with (unique=true);    
```    
    
Please notice that Lsm3 creates bgworker merge process for each Lsm3 index.    
So you may need to adjust `max_worker_processes` in postgresql.conf to be large enough.    
    
```    
postgres=# create index idx on t using lsm3(id) with (unique=true);    
postgres=# insert into t select generate_series(1,10000000), md5(random()::text);    
    
postgres=# \dt+ t    
                           List of relations    
 Schema | Name | Type  |  Owner   | Persistence |  Size  | Description     
--------+------+-------+----------+-------------+--------+-------------    
 public | t    | table | postgres | permanent   | 651 MB |     
    
 public | idx              | index | postgres | t           | permanent   | 69 GB      |     
```    
    
lsm3索引膨胀比较厉害.
