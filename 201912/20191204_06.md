## 背景      
PostgreSQL 13增加参数logical_decoding_work_mem控制每个decode(wal sender process)在decode walrecord时的buffer大小，当超过buffer时，写磁盘。  
  
如果上游(wal sender端)的wal产生量大，decoding量大，增加logical_decoding_work_mem，可以减少写local disk的io，提高性能。  
  
同时需要注意服务器的内存是否足够，最多可能耗费logical_decoding_work_mem\*max_wal_senders  
  
logical_decoding_work_mem (integer)  
  
  
Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by logical decoding, before some of the decoded changes are written to local disk. This limits the amount of memory used by logical streaming replication connections. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB). Since each replication connection only uses a single buffer of this size, and an installation normally doesn't have many such connections concurrently (as limited by max_wal_senders), it's safe to set this value significantly higher than work_mem, reducing the amount of decoded changes written to disk.  
  
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=cec2edfa7859279f36d2374770ca920c59c73dd8  
  
    
```  
Add logical_decoding_work_mem to limit ReorderBuffer memory usage.  
  
Instead of deciding to serialize a transaction merely based on the  
number of changes in that xact (toplevel or subxact), this makes  
the decisions based on amount of memory consumed by the changes.  
  
The memory limit is defined by a new logical_decoding_work_mem GUC,  
so for example we can do this  
  
    SET logical_decoding_work_mem = '128kB'  
  
to reduce the memory usage of walsenders or set the higher value to  
reduce disk writes. The minimum value is 64kB.  
  
When adding a change to a transaction, we account for the size in  
two places. Firstly, in the ReorderBuffer, which is then used to  
decide if we reached the total memory limit. And secondly in the  
transaction the change belongs to, so that we can pick the largest  
transaction to evict (and serialize to disk).  
  
We still use max_changes_in_memory when loading changes serialized  
to disk. The trouble is we can't use the memory limit directly as  
there might be multiple subxact serialized, we need to read all of  
them but we don't know how many are there (and which subxact to  
read first).  
  
We do not serialize the ReorderBufferTXN entries, so if there is a  
transaction with many subxacts, most memory may be in this type of  
objects. Those records are not included in the memory accounting.  
  
We also do not account for INTERNAL_TUPLECID changes, which are  
kept in a separate list and not evicted from memory. Transactions  
with many CTID changes may consume significant amounts of memory,  
but we can't really do much about that.  
  
The current eviction algorithm is very simple - the transaction is  
picked merely by size, while it might be useful to also consider age  
(LSN) of the changes for example. With the new Generational memory  
allocator, evicting the oldest changes would make it more likely  
the memory gets actually pfreed.  
  
The logical_decoding_work_mem can be set in postgresql.conf, in which  
case it serves as the default for all publishers on that instance.
