pg_dump: Add support for zstd compression  
  
Allow pg_dump to use the zstd compression, in addition to gzip/lz4. Bulk  
of the new compression method is implemented in compress_zstd.{c,h},  
covering the pg_dump compression APIs. The rest of the patch adds test  
and makes various places aware of the new compression method.  
  
The zstd library (which this patch relies on) supports multithreaded  
compression since version 1.5. We however disallow that feature for now,  
as it might interfere with parallel backups on platforms that rely on  
threads (e.g. Windows). This can be improved / relaxed in the future.  
  
This also fixes a minor issue in InitDiscoverCompressFileHandle(), which  
was not updated to check if the file already has the .lz4 extension.  
  
Adding zstd compression was originally proposed in 2020 (see the second  
thread), but then was reworked to use the new compression API introduced  
in e9960732a9. I've considered both threads when compiling the list of  
reviewers.
