## 背景    
数据库日志中可能包括业务相关敏感信息，例如字段值，用户密码等。例如：      
  
```  
log_statement = 'ddl'  
  
  
pg12@pg11-test-> psql  
psql (12beta2)  
Type "help" for help.  
  
postgres=# create role digoal login encrypted password 'digoal123321123321';  
CREATE ROLE  
```  
  
对应日志：  
  
```  
2019-09-01 15:10:50.024 CST,"postgres","postgres",54405,"[local]",5d6b6eec.d485,3,"idle",2019-09-01 15:10:36 CST,3/4293645,0,LOG,00000,"statement: create role digoal login encrypted password 'digoal123321123321';",,,,,,,,"exec_simple_query, postgres.c:1045","psql"  
```  
  
这个补丁的思路是对敏感信息进行遮掩（目前还没有完结，没有合并到主分支）。

Logs are important to diagnose problems or monitor operations, but logs  
can contain sensitive information which is often unnecessary for these  
purposes. Redacting the sensitive information would enable easier  
access and simpler integration with analysis tools without compromising  
the sensitive information.  
  
The challenge is that nobody wants to classify all of the log messages;  
and even if someone did that today, there would be never-ending work in  
the future to try to maintain that classification.  
  
My proposal is:  
  
 * redact every '%s' in an ereport by having a special mode for  
snprintf.c (this is possible because we now own snprintf)  
 * generate both redacted and unredacted messages (if redaction is  
enabled)  
 * choose which destinations (stderr, eventlog, syslog, csvlog) get  
redacted or plain messages  
 * emit_log_hook always has both redacted and plain messages available  
 * allow specifying a custom redaction function, e.g. a function that  
hashes the string rather than completely redacting it  
  
I think '%s' in a log message is a pretty close match to the kind of  
information that might be sensitive. All data goes through type output  
functions (e.g. the conflicting datum for a unique constraint violation  
message), and most other things that a user might type would go through  
%s. A lot of other information useful in logs, like LSNs, %m's, PIDs,  
etc. would be preserved.  
  
All object names would be redacted, but that's not as bad as it sounds:  
  (a) You can specify a custom redaction function that hashes rather  
than completely redacts. That allows you to see if different messages  
refer to the same object, and also map back to suspected objects if you  
really need to.  
  (b) The unredacted object names are still a part of ErrorData, so you  
can do something interesting with emit_log_hook.  
  (c) You still might have the unredacted logs in a more protected  
place, and can access them when you really need to.  
  
A weakness of this proposal is that it could be confusing to use  
ereport() in combination with snprintf(). If using snprintf to build  
the format string, nothing would be redacted, so you'd have to be  
careful not to expand any %s that might be sensitive. If using snprintf  
to build up an argument, the entire argument would be redacted. The  
first case should not be common, because good coding generally avoids  
non-constant format strings. The second case is just over-redaction,  
which is not necessarily bad.  
  
One annoying case would be if some of the arguments to ereport() are  
used for things like the right number of commas or tabs -- redacting  
those would just make the message look horrible. I didn't find such  
cases but I'm pretty sure they exist. Another annoying case is time,  
which is useful for debugging, but formatted with %s so it gets  
redacted (I did find plenty of these cases).  
  
But I don't see a better solution. Right now, it's a pain to treat log  
files as sensitive things when there are so many ways they can help  
with smooth operations and so many tools available to analyze them.  
This proposal seems like a practical solution to enable better use of  
log files while protecting potentially-sensitive information.  
  
Attached is a WIP patch.
