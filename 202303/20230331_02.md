## 背景     
pg_walinspect 插件是pg提供的用于分析wal日志文件的插件, 使用SQL接口即可分析wal日志.  
  
PG 16 增强 pg_walinspect 插件的 pg_get_wal_block_info 函数返回更多wal block级别信息.   
  
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=122376f028a0e31b91d6c6bad2a9a6e994708547  
  
```  
Show record information in pg_get_wal_block_info.  
  
Expand the output parameters in pg_walinspect's pg_get_wal_block_info  
function to return additional information that was previously only  
available from pg_walinspect's pg_get_wal_records_info function.  Some  
of the details are attributed to individual block references, rather  
than aggregated into whole-record values, since the function returns one  
row per block reference per WAL record (unlike pg_get_wal_records_info,  
which always returns one row per WAL record).  
  
This structure is much easier to work with when writing queries that  
track how individual blocks changed over time, or when attributing costs  
to individual blocks (not WAL records) is useful.  
  
This is the second time that pg_get_wal_block_info has been enhanced in  
recent weeks.  Commit 9ecb134a expanded on the original version of the  
function added in commit c31cf1c0 (where it first appeared under the  
name pg_get_wal_fpi_info).  There still hasn't been a stable release  
since commit c31cf1c0, so no bump in the pg_walinspect extension  
version.
