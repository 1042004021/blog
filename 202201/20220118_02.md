## 背景     
  
pg_upgrade 需要将旧集群的元数据导入新集群, 此前需要更新文件名, 表空间和数据库oid. 虽然这些变化看起来很轻量, 但是由于文件名等发生变化可能导致问题, 保留与旧集群一致的relfilenodes, tablespace oid, database oid 可以带来如下好处:   
- (1) it makes troubleshooting pg_upgrade easier, since you don't have to do a lot of work to match up files in the old and new clusters,   
- (2) it allows 'rsync' to save bandwidth when used to re-sync a cluster after an upgrade, and   
- (3) if we ever encrypt or sign blocks, we would likely want to use a nonce that depends on these values.    
    
PG 15改进, 保留了与旧集群一致的relfilenodes, tablespace oid, database oid.

pg_upgrade: Preserve relfilenodes and tablespace OIDs.  
  
Currently, database OIDs, relfilenodes, and tablespace OIDs can all  
change when a cluster is upgraded using pg_upgrade. It seems better  
to preserve them, because   
  
(1) it makes troubleshooting pg_upgrade easier,   
since you don't have to do a lot of work to match up files in the old and new clusters,   
(2) it allows 'rsync' to save bandwidth when used to re-sync a cluster after an upgrade, and   
(3) if we ever encrypt or sign blocks, we would likely want to use a nonce that  
depends on these values.    
  
This patch only arranges to preserve relfilenodes and tablespace  
OIDs. The task of preserving database OIDs is left for another patch,  
since it involves some complexities that don't exist in these cases.  
  
Database OIDs have a similar issue, but there are some tricky points  
in that case that do not apply to these cases, so that problem is left  
for another patch.  
  
Shruthi KC, based on an earlier patch from Antonin Houska, reviewed  
and with some adjustments by me.
