## 背景        
Tuned is a system tuning service for Linux. It:  
- monitors connected devices using the udev device manager  
- tunes system settings according to a selected profile  
- supports various types of configuration like sysctl, sysfs, or kernel boot command line parameters, which are integrated in a plug-in architecture  
- supports hot plugging of devices and can be controlled from the command line or through D-Bus, so it can be easily integrated into existing administering solutions: for example, with Cockpit  
- can be run in no-daemon mode with limited functionality (for example, no support for D-Bus, udev, tuning of newly created processes, and so on) for systems with reduced resources  
- stores all its configuration cleanly in one place – in the Tuned profile – instead of having configuration on multiple places and in custom scripts

Available profiles:  
- balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile  
- desktop                     - Optimize for the desktop use-case  
- hpc-compute                 - Optimize for HPC compute workloads  
- latency-performance         - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption  
- network-latency             - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance  
- network-throughput          - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks  
- powersave                   - Optimize for low power consumption  
- throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads  
- virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest  
- virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests  
Current active profile: virtual-guest

可以自定义profile, 统一管理, 不需要在多个配置文件中配置OS .
