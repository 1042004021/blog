ghtree实现的海明距离排序索引, 性能不错   
  
  
- ghtree: This is a simple Generalized Hyperplane tree (gh-tree) using SP-GiST indexing facilities, with good performance. It's constructed as described here (backup link). "At the top node, pick two points. Then, divide the remaining points based on which of these two they are closer to. Now, recursively build both branches. This method is an improvement [against VP-trees] in that it is symmetric and the tree structure still tends to be well balanced."  
- old: This was my initial implementation using a VP-tree. Although fast for Euclidean space, for some reason it performs extremely poorly when the Hamming metric is used (~10 seconds on 10M records, as bad as linear search for me). I also tried Alexander Korotkov's higher splitting-degree version as a base, with the same results. I gave up on this when I found gh-trees.  
  
My test system is an Ideapad 120S with 2 GB RAM, Celeron N3350 @ 1.1Ghz (sorry), OS Debian Stretch.  
  
Nearest-neighbor search on 10 million BIGINT records takes approx 150 milliseconds. (Probably faster with a decent computer.) Test as follows:  
  
```  
CREATE EXTENSION ghtree;  
CREATE TABLE gh_test AS (SELECT floor(random()*9223372036854775807)::BIGINT AS value FROM generate_series(0,10000000) AS i);  
CREATE INDEX gh_idx ON gh_test USING spgist(value ghtree_ops);  
\timing  
SELECT * FROM gh_test ORDER BY value <=> floor(random()*9223372036854775807)::BIGINT LIMIT 10;  
```
